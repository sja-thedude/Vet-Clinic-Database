# VET CLINIC DATABASE

Vet Clinic is Module 4 project at Microverse. Vet Clinic is Relational database used to create the initial data structure. Created and Updated a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

## Getting Started

- Used [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Used [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Checked [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
